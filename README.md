# Master Android Application Development

This is my own way, based on the [book](https://goo.gl/H5guft).

##### Why did I ended up starting from scratch?
I got a bit frustrated when started chapter II of the book. Many of the examples where given as
"run" this, following a block of code without referencing any possible file were to place it.

The most annoying thing has been not being able to run the example code provided on a more recent
Android Studio instance.

Maybe when writing a book, the best would be to find a way to make examples more flexible to be used
in the future, if only slight changes come to the platform, as in this case.
